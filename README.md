# CS-230 Coursework Portfolio

## Reflection of The Gaming Room Project
The Gaming Room tasked us with expanding their Android app, "Draw It or Lose It", into a web-based game to reach a broader audience. They required a system that was multi-platform compatible, 
easy to access and maintain, with unique identifiers for players and games, and capable of supporting multiple players and teams within a single instance. The goal was to maintain the game's
integrity and user interface across all platforms. 

## Strengths in Documentation Development
I excelled in creating a comprehensive and clear design document that detailed every aspect of the system architecture, from user interactions to backend logic. My ability to articulate the 
technical specifications and the rationale behind design choices stand out, making it easier for both the client and development team to understand the project scope and objectives.

## Value of the Design Document in Development
Working through the design document proved invaluable for coding. It served as a roadmap, outlining the system's architecture and interactions, which streamlined the development process. The
document helped anticipate challenges and design solutions upfront, reducing the need for significant changes during development.

## Area for Improvement
If I were the revise the documentation, I would focus on enhancing the user experience design section. Although functional, incorporating more user feedback and iterative design could have 
made the interface more intuitive and engaging. Future revisions would include user testing phases to refine UI/UX based on direct user input.

## Interpreting and Implementing 
Interpreting user needs was crucial for designing a system that was not only functional but also enjoyable to use. By focusing on the user experience and involving users early in the design,
we ensured the game met their expectations and was accessible across different platforms. This user-centric approach underpins the importance of considering user needs as a foundation for
design.

## My Approach to Designing Software
My approach to designing software emphasizes comprehensive planning, stakeholder engagement, and flexibility to adapt to feedback. Techniques such as use case analysis, prototyping, and 
employing design patterns like MVC for system organization were instrumental. For future projects, I plan to integrate more of an agile methodology in my approach to software design
and development to enhance collaboration and responsiveness to change.
